# Neural Network-Based Iris Classification Model

This project demonstrates the development of a neural network model using Keras to classify the Iris dataset. The implementation includes preprocessing, dimensionality reduction with PCA, visualization, and model evaluation.

## Features
- Data preprocessing: Label Encoding, One-Hot Encoding, and Standard Scaling.
- Dimensionality reduction using PCA for 2D visualization.
- Deep learning model architecture:
  - Two hidden layers with varying activation functions (ReLU, Sigmoid, Tanh).
  - Final softmax layer for multi-class classification.
- Hyperparameter tuning for learning rates and activation functions.
- Visualizations:
  - Decision boundary plot for PCA-reduced features.
  - Learning rate and activation function comparisons through training loss.

## Technologies Used
- **Python**: Programming language
- **Keras**: Neural network framework
- **Scikit-learn**: Data preprocessing, PCA, and model evaluation tools
- **Matplotlib**: Visualization of results and decision boundaries
- **NumPy & Pandas**: Data manipulation and analysis

## Dataset
The Iris dataset is used in this project. It contains 150 samples of three species of Iris flowers: Setosa, Versicolor, and Virginica. Each sample has four features:
1. Sepal length
2. Sepal width
3. Petal length
4. Petal width

The dataset is publicly available and commonly used for machine learning projects.

## Project Workflow
1. **Data Preparation**:
   - Load the Iris dataset.
   - Preprocess target labels with label encoding and one-hot encoding.
   - Scale the feature data using `StandardScaler`.

2. **PCA for Dimensionality Reduction**:
   - Reduced the feature space to two dimensions for visualization.

3. **Neural Network Model**:
   - Created a deep learning model with two hidden layers.
   - Experimented with ReLU, Sigmoid, and Tanh activation functions.
   - Compared learning rates: 0.001, 0.01, and 0.1.

4. **Evaluation and Visualization**:
   - Evaluated test accuracy and loss.
   - Visualized decision boundaries using PCA components.
   - Compared activation functions and learning rates with loss plots.

## Results
- Achieved 99% test accuracy.
- Observed that the best activation function is sigmoid at a learning rate of 0.01.
